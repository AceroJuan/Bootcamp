                     <h3>IS MY JACK DANIEL'S TIN BOX AN ANTIQUE?</h3>
                     <p> Our tin boxes are "antique replicas" that have been produced since the early 1970s. We use them for our "holiday packages," which are sold in selected
                         stores around Christmas. Now and then folks tell us they find the tin boxes at flea markets, garage sales, and even antique stores; however, they would not be considered authentic antiques. </p>

                     <h3>IS JACK DANIEL'S A BOURBON?</h3>
                     <p>Jack Daniel's is not a bourbon - it's a Tennessee Whiskey. Jack Daniel's is dripped slowly - drop-by-drop - through ten feet of firmly packed charcoal (made from hard sugar maple) before going into new charred oak barrels for maturing. This special process gives Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey its rare smoothness. It's this extra step - charcoal mellowing – that makes Jack Daniel's a Tennessee Whiskey. 
                         Take a look at our Process section for more information about how Jack Daniel’s is made. </p>

                     <p>Jack Daniel's Green Label is a lighter, less mature whiskey with a lighter color and character. The barrels selected for Green Label tend to be on the lower floors and more toward the center of the warehouse where the whiskey matures more slowly.
